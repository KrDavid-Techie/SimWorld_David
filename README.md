## üî• News
 - 2025.6 The first formal release of **SimWorld** has been published! üöÄ
 - 2025.3 Our demo of **SimWolrd** been accepted by CVPR 2025 Demostration Tack! üéâ

## üí° Introduction
Most existing embodied simulators focus on indoor environments. While there are urban simulators, many either lack realism or are limited to specific domains, such as autonomous driving. Moreover, these simulators often don't allow users to dynamically generate new scenes or define custom AI tasks. The main goal of SimWorld is to help bridge the gap between agent performance in structured digital domains and the dynamic challenges of the real world. To do so, the platform is designed to be a foundational tool for advancing real-world agent intelligence across a variety of disciplines.

SimWorld is built on Unreal Engine 5 and offers core capabilities to meet the needs of modern agent development. It provides (1) realistic, open-ended world simulation with accurate physics and language-based procedural generation. Control and interaction are handled through (2) a rich interface for LLM/VLM agents, supporting multi-modal perception and natural language actions. Finally, SimWorld includes (3) diverse and customizable physical and social reasoning scenarios, enabling systematic training and evaluation of complex agent behaviors like navigation, planning, and strategic cooperation.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

![Architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5f43638-7583-483f-aadc-1ddf5d6ff27a)

SimWorld's architecture is designed to be modular and flexible, supporting an array of functionalities such as dynamic world generation, agent control, and performance benchmarking. The components are seamlessly integrated to provide a robust platform for **Embodied AI** and **Agents** research and applications.

## Setup
### Installation
+ Python Client
Make sure to use Python 3.10 or later.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/renjw02/SimWorld.git
cd SimWorld
conda create -n simworld python=3.10
conda activate simworld
pip install -e .
```

+ UE server
Download the SimWorld server executable from S3:

    + Windows. Download the [SimWorld Windows 64-bit Server (v0.1.0)](https://simworld-release.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/SimWorld-Win64-v0_1_0-Foundation.zip) and unzip it.
    + Linux. Download the [SimWorld Linux 64-bit Server (v0.1.0)](https://simworld-release.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/SimWorld-Linux-v0_1_0-Foundation.zip) and unzip it.

### Quick Start

We provide several examples of code in `scripts/`, showcasing how to use the basic functionalities of SimWorld, including city layout generation, traffic simulation, asset retrieval, and activity-to-actions. Please follow the examples to see how SimWorld works.

#### Configuration

SimWorld uses YAML-formatted configuration files for system settings. The default configuration files are located in the `./simworld/config` directory while user configurations are placed in the `./config` directory.

- `./simworld/config/default.yaml` serves as the default configuration file.
- `./config/example.yaml` is provided as a template for custom configurations.

Users can switch between different configurations by specifying a custom configuration file path through the `Config` class:

To set up your own configuration:

1. Create your custom configuration by copying the example template:
   ```bash
   cp ./config/example.yaml ./config/your_config.yaml
   ```

2. Modify the configuration values in `your_config.yaml` according to your needs

3. Load your custom configuration in your code:
   ```python
   from simworld.config import Config
   config = Config('path/to/your_config')    # use absolute path here
   ```



## For Contributors
### Precommit Setup
We use Google docstring format for our docstrings and the pre-commit library to check our code. To install pre-commit, run the following command:

```bash
conda install pre-commit  # or pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

The pre-commit hooks will run automatically when you try to commit changes to the repository.


### Commit Message Guidelines
All commit messages should be clear, concise, and follow this format:
```
<type>: <short summary>

[optional body explaining the change]
```
Recommended types:
+ feat: A new feature
+ fix: A bug fix
+ docs: Documentation changes
+ refactor: Code restructuring without behavior changes
+ style: Code style changes (formatting, linting)
+ test: Adding or updating tests
+ chore: Non-code changes (e.g., updating dependencies)

Example:
```
feat: add user login API
```
