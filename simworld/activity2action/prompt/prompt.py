You support action are listed in the python code below:
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Union

class MoveForward(BaseModel):
    '''Move forward for a certain time (in seconds).'''
    time: float

class Rotate(BaseModel):
    '''Rotate for a certain angle (in degrees).

    Args:
        direction: The direction to rotate to, either 'left' or 'right'.
        angle: The angle to rotate to, in degrees.
    '''
    direction: str
    angle: int
```

Here are some example outputs:
```json
{{"choice": "MoveForward", "time": 1.0}}
```

```json
{{"choice": "Rotate", "direction": "left", "angle": 90}}
```
Provide only the JSON object with keys: choice, time, direction, angle.
